Scripts to automatically update a few Nix-related things, like the version of `nix-direnv` in `.envrc` files and the NixOS release in of the `nixpkgs` flake input.

== Usage

Use Nix to incorporate these scripts in your project.
Here's an example of how to incorporate this repository's flake as part of your project and run the provided scripts.

.flake.nix
[,nix]
----
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    nix-update-scripts = {
      url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };
  };
  outputs = {};
}
----

Examples of how to use these scripts in GitHub Actions can be found in the link:.github/workflows/update-nix-direnv.yaml[update-nix-direnv workflow] and the link:.github/workflows/update-nixos-release.yaml[update-nixos-release workflow].

== Develop

The `nix develop` command can be used to enter or run commands in an environment with all of the necessary dependencies.
For convenience, direnv can be used to automatically load this environment when entering the project's directory.
The https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mkhl.direnv[mkhl.direnv VSCode extension] integrates this environment in VSCode for development.
Nix also generates the configuration for https://pre-commit.com/[pre-commit], which automates formatting and various checks when committing changes.
Follow the instructions here to set up your development environment using Nix.

. Install an implementation of {Nix}, such as https://lix.systems[Lix] used here.
+
[,sh]
----
curl -sSf -L https://install.lix.systems/lix | sh -s -- install
----

. Clone this project's repository.
+
[,sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/jwillikers/nix-update-scripts.git
----

. Change into the project directory.
+
[,sh]
----
cd nix-update-scripts
----

. Install direnv for your system according to the https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html[direnv installation instructions].
+
[,sh]
----
sudo rpm-ostree install direnv
sudo systemctl reboot
----

. Integrate direnv with your shell by following the instructions on the https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html[direnv Setup page].

. Permit the direnv configuration for the repository.
+
[,sh]
----
direnv allow
----

. Use `nix run` to run the appropriate target.
+
[,sh]
----
nix run '.#update-nix-direnv'
----

=== Just

Many of the necessary tasks for development have dedicated just commands.
Here is the briefest overview.

. For local development, the `just run` command can be used to run commands after mounting the local directory on the device.
By default, it it will execute the main.py file, but other commands to `mpremote` can be provided as the first argument.
+
[,sh]
----
just run
----

. To update dependencies, run `just update`.
+
[,sh]
----
just update
----

. Use `just --list` to list other available tasks.
+
[,sh]
----
just --list
